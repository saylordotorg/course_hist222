**Unit 9: Latin America in the 21st Century** <span id="9"></span> 
*By the late 1980s, many Latin Americans had grown weary of military
rule. The fall of the Soviet Union and the diminishing threat of
international Communism prompted demands for democratic elections and a
return to civilian rule across the region. By the early 1990s,
democratically elected leaders had taken charge of most of the major
nations in Latin America. Nevertheless, the region continued to face
severe economic and social challenges in the 1990s and 2000s. Many Latin
American countries struggled under the weight of generations of failed
economic development projects. They owed large debts to American and
European investors and did not have the money to expand domestic
economies. The region also suffered from chronic problems resulting from
the unequal distribution of wealth. Many poor people turned to the
illicit drug trade for income and nations like Colombia and Nicaragua
became centers for illegal drug production and distribution. Frustration
over the uneven distribution of wealth also led to the emergence of
anti-neoliberal political movements in countries like Mexico and
Venezuela. These political movements championed the political and
economic rights of poor, often indigenous people and challenged the
political power of large corporations and the supposed benefits of
free-market, global trade for developing nations. *  
    
 *In this final unit, you will study contemporary political, economic,
and social movements across Latin America and examine how post-colonial
development in the region has led to profound criticisms of
globalization and free-market capitalism. You will also explore the ways
in which certain Latin American nations, such as Brazil, have emerged as
regional and international powers and evaluate what the future may hold
for the other nations of the region.  *
