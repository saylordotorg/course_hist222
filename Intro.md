This course will introduce you to the history of Latin America from the
early 19<sup>th</sup> century, when many Latin American colonies
declared their independence from European rule (predominately Spain and
Portugal), to the present day. This course fulfills one of the required
six geographical concentration courses for the [History
major](http://www.saylor.org/majors/history/). This course also fulfills
one of the requirements for the [History
minor](http://www.saylor.org/history-minor/). In this course, you will
learn about the major political, economic, and social changes that took
place throughout Latin America during this crucial 200-year period of
nation-state formation and engagement with the rest of the world. The
units in the course are set up chronologically, but at the same time the
units address the development and history of specific Latin American
regions, including Mexico, Central America, and South America, and
nation-states. Each unit includes representative primary-source
documents that illustrate important overarching political, economic, and
social themes, such as efforts by independent Latin American nations to
create stable economies in the 19<sup>th</sup> century in the face of
colonial and mercantile systems, the political and economic conflicts
among independent states and European imperial powers, the emergence of
often extreme left-wing and right-wing political and social movements in
the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the developmental challenges that many
Latin American nations face today, and the recent ascendance of certain
Latin American nations economically, politically, and socially. By the
end of the course, you will understand how the countries of the region
have overcome significant social, economic, and political problems as
they have grown from weak former colonies into modern nation-states. You
will be able to think critically about the history of Latin and South
America from the 19<sup>th</sup> century to the present.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   analyze how the peoples of Latin America attempted to organize
    viable nation-states following independence from Spanish and
    Portuguese colonial rule;
-   assess how the United States used economic and cultural imperialism
    to control the economic, social, and political development of Latin
    America;
-   identify the origins of the 1910 Mexican Revolution and assess the
    political, economic, and social impacts of the revolution for the
    people of Mexico;
-   assess the role that Latin American nations played in the global
    economy in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries;
-   analyze the role that cultural agents such as the Catholic Church
    played in the development of Latin American nations;
-   explain the role played by women, indigenous peoples, and
    Afro-Latinos in the social and political development of Latin
    America;
-   evaluate the political and economic factors that led to the
    emergence of political dictatorships in many Latin American nations
    in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century;
-   analyze how Cold War struggles between capitalist and communist
    ideologies influenced political life in the nations of Latin America
    and led to the rise of repressive, authoritarian regimes in the
    1970s and 1980s; 
-   evaluate the current state of contemporary Latin America, taking in
    mind its pre-Colombian, colonial, and post-colonial history, to
    surmise its future challenges and advantages in a world of
    globalization; and
-   analyze and interpret primary source documents from the
    19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, using historical
    research methods to garner a more profound understanding of Latin
    American history.
