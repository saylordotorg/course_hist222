**Unit 6: Gender and Race in Modern Latin America** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Since the colonial period, gender and race have played an important
role in shaping Latin American society. In the postcolonial era, women
began to demand a greater role in national life. After they achieved
independence at the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, some Latin
American nations granted women the right to vote. On the other hand,
many public institutions continued to discriminate against women. In the
late 19<sup>th</sup> century, feminists in nations such as Argentina
began advocating for women to be admitted to institutions of higher
education. They also agitated for new laws regarding women’s rights to
their own bodies and their legal rights in marriage and
divorce. Indigenous peoples and Latin Americans of African descent also
became more assertive about their political and economic rights in the
20<sup>th</sup> century. Both groups also demanded recognition of their
ethnic heritage and cultural values by dominant elites of European
ancestry. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will look at different ways that women and people of
indigenous and African ancestry challenged the power and dominance of
white male authorities throughout Latin America. You will also look at
how these groups created unique cultural expressions of their
backgrounds.*

     Instructions: Read this excerpt from Echenique’s essay, “The
    Emancipation of Women.” In this essay, 19<sup>th</sup>-century
    Argentinean feminist Maria Eugenia Echenique argues that women are

    educate themselves in order to be intellectually equal to men in
    Argentinean society. She concludes that only by doing this will
    Argentine women be truly emancipated.
