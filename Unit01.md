**Unit 1: Independence amidst Imperialism** <span id="1"></span> 
*During the first three decades of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, every
Spanish and Portuguese colony in the Western Hemisphere, with the
exception of Cuba and Puerto Rico, achieved political
independence. Freedom from European rule represented only the first step
in a long and arduous process of nation-building. Over the course of the
19<sup>th</sup> century, Latin American political leaders gradually
organized national governments, developed local economies, and attempted
to resolve regional conflicts through negotiations and military force.
Local elites of European decent controlled political life in most Latin
American nations. Poor inhabitants of mixed ancestry, who comprised the
majority of the population, held little political power. In many
nations, disputes between contending factions of the political elite led
to periodic coups and revolutions throughout the 19<sup>th</sup>
century. Typically, poor inhabitants were caught in the middle of these
broader political and military struggles and suffered dreadful
consequences. *  
    
 *While the nations of Latin America gained political independence in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century, most countries remained tethered to former
colonial powers by economic bonds. Spanish and Portuguese investors
controlled many local businesses and served as sources of capital for
economic development. British investors also began to organize local
companies in many Latin American nations and used their economic power
to influence political affairs in these nations. European economic
imperialism had a profound influence over the economic and political
development of the nations of Latin America. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will examine how independent Latin American nations
grew economically, politically, and socially over the course of the
19<sup>th</sup> century. You will evaluate the ways in which European
imperialism shaped political and economic life in Latin American
countries. You will also look at the regional military conflicts that
shaped the modern-day boundaries of these nations and explore the
consequences of these conflicts for the former Spanish and Portuguese
colonies.  *
