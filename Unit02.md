**Unit 2: Latin America and the United States** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, the
United States began to exert significant economic, political, and
military influence over Latin American nations. In 1898, American
military forces invaded and occupied Cuba and Puerto Rico as part of a
broader war against Spain. As a result of the Spanish-American War,
Puerto Rico became a US protectorate and Cuba gained its independence,
although the United States maintained a close watch over Cuban political
affairs. By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, American corporations,
such as the powerful United Fruit Company, owned vast tracts of lands
throughout the Caribbean and South America. These firms commonly used
bribery and intimidation to influence political affairs in the
so-called* *Banana Republicsof Latin America. The United States
government backed American corporations with military force; American
political leaders such as President Theodore Roosevelt expressed a clear
willingness to intervene in the internal affairs of independent nations
in order to protect American and European investments. In 1904, the US
government also became involved in the massive project to build a
sea-level canal across the Isthmus of Panama. When the Panama Canal was
completed 10 years later, it allowed the United States to exert
tremendous economic and military influence throughout the region. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will examine the relationship between the United
States and the nations of Latin America in the 19<sup>th</sup> and early
20<sup>th</sup> centuries. You will also evaluate how America’s
involvement in Latin American affairs influenced (for better or worse)
the economic and political development of Latin American nations during
this time period, especially in the years leading up to World War II.  *

     Instructions: Read Roosevelt’s third annual message to Congress in
    1904. In this speech to Congress, President Theodore Roosevelt
    presented a new diplomatic policy that would later be referred to as
    the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. The Roosevelt
    Corollary asserted the right of the United States to intervene and
    stabilize the economic affairs of small states in the Caribbean and
    Central America if they were unable to pay their international
    debt. Roosevelt coined the term *dollar diplomacy* for this type of
    policy, because American military interventions in Latin America
    generally resulted from local interference with American firms or
    unpaid debts to European firms. Though Roosevelt coined the term,
    this type of policy is mostly associated with President William
    Howard Taft.
