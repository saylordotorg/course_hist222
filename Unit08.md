**Unit 8: Authoritarianism in the 1970s and 1980s** <span
id="8"></span> 
*The political chaos of the 1950s and 1960s - particularly the emergence
of organized Socialist and Communist parties in industrializing nations
such as Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil - led to major political
crackdowns by conservative military leaders in the 1970s and
1980s. Often, these ruthless political leaders received covert - and at
times overt - support from American officials, who viewed Latin America
as a new front in the international war against Communism and the Soviet
Union. In Chile, Socialist Salvador Allende was elected president in
1970. As he began to nationalize foreign-owned business and reorganize
the Chilean economy, the US government and the Central Intelligence
Agency began encouraging Chilean military officials to stage a coup. The
coup took place in 1973, Allende committed suicide, and military leaders
took control of the nation, rounding up opposition supporters and having
them disappear, often through torture and secret executions. Similar
crackdowns on leftist political movements took place in Argentina,
Brazil, and Uruguay during the same time period. By the end of the
1970s, authoritarian military leaders with US backing had seized control
of many of the nations of Latin America in order to keep them free from
Socialist or Communist political influences. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will learn how military forces took control of major
Latin American nations in the 1970s and look at the social and economic
consequences of authoritarian rule in the region. You will also study
the ways in which civil rights abuses and political repression by
military regimes influenced social and cultural life in the region and
led to resistance campaigns in some nations.  *

     Instructions: Read these six articles from *Colombia: A Country
    Study.* Under the National Front regime in 1958–1974, the presidency
    of Colombia was to be determined by an alternating conservative and
    liberal president every 4 years for 16 years; the two parties would
    have parity in all other elective offices. The results of the
    successive Liberal and Conservative administrations had mixed
    results. From 1974 until 1982, different presidential
    administrations focused on ending the persistent insurgencies that
    sought to undermine Colombia’s traditional political system.
