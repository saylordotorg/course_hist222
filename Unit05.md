**Unit 5: Social and Cultural Agents in the 19th and 20th Centuries**
<span id="5"></span> 
*Social and cultural agents helped shape distinct regional and national
identities across Latin America in the 19<sup>th</sup> and
20<sup>th</sup> centuries. The Catholic Church was by far the most
significant of these agents. The church played a major role in Latin
American society, both as an agent of conservative control and
revolutionary change. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, elites used the
conservative influence of the church to promote national unity and
acceptance of social and class distinctions. On the other hand, in the
20<sup>th</sup> century, radical priests used church institutions to
champion social justice and attack corrupt political leaders across the
region. Along with church institutions, artists and writers shaped the
regional and national identities through their work. Nobel Prize winners
in Literature from Latin America, like Gabriela Mistral, Pablo Neruda,
Gabriel Garcia Marques, Octavio Paz, and Jose Sarmago, examined local
history and regional cultures and highlighted the unique blend of
European and indigenous identities and cultural values in countries like
Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, Brazil, and Mexico. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will look at how specific social and cultural agents
shaped distinct identities in Latin American nations. You will also
examine how these cultural agents have been exported throughout the
world during the 20<sup>th</sup> century.*
