**Unit 7: Dictatorships and Revolutions of the Mid-20th Century** <span
id="7"></span> 
*The 1940s through 1960s were a time of significant political
instability throughout Latin America. Electoral chaos in the 1920s and
1930s and growing political conflicts between radical populists and
conservative elites led to the emergence of military dictatorships, or
conservative political regimes backed by the military, in many Latin
American states in the 1940s. These conservative rulers feared the
growing influence of Socialist and Communist political movements among
the factory workers and farmers who made up the majority of the
population in many countries. As left-wing political movements grew in
strength, many conservative rulers attempted to suppress them through
military force or political intimidation. By the 1950s, elite rulers
could no longer hold back revolutionary armies in a number of Latin
American nations, including Bolivia and Cuba. In a few states,
conservative leaders such as Argentinean Juan Peron attempted to
implement moderate social reforms while maintaining strict control over
political affairs. In other states, radical leaders were elected to
political office and attempted to implement major economic and social
reforms. Often, these reform efforts led to broader social chaos and
prompted conservative military leaders to stage coups in order to
restore social order. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will examine the political chaos of the 1940s–1960s
and will look at how radical and conservative forces vied for control
over many Latin American nations. You will also examine some of the
economic and social reforms that radicals attempted, such as the
redistribution of farmland and the nationalization of foreign
businesses. Finally, you will study how the political struggles in Latin
America fit into the broader Cold War struggle between the United States
and the Soviet Union.  *
