**Unit 3: The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1920** <span id="3"></span> 
*The Mexican Revolution, which lasted from 1910 through the early 1920s,
played a significant role in reshaping political and social life in
Mexico, and it had profound implications for the broader political
culture of Latin America during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. The revolution began as a reaction against the 30-year rule of
autocratic Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. As president, Diaz had
favored the landed elites in Mexico and encouraged Europe and the United
States to invest in the Mexican economy. Diaz’s policies did little to
help poor workers and farmers, who made up much of the Mexican
population. In 1910, Diaz blocked the election of opposition candidate
Francisco Madero by briefly throwing him in jail and forcing him to flee
Mexico. Madero responded by issuing the “Plan of San Luis Potosi,” a
revolutionary manifesto asking the people of Mexico to rise up against
Diaz. In the military conflict that followed, Madero received help from
a broad coalition of supporters that included indigenous peoples, poor
farmers, urban workers, and political radicals. With their help, Diaz
was removed from office and Madero was elected president in 1911. *  
    
 *Madero’s rule as president was short-lived, as his policies managed to
offend both radical and conservative supporters. In 1913, conservative
military officer Victoriano Huerta staged a coup and removed Madero from
office. Madero was assassinated a few months later. His assassination
destabilized Mexico and led to renewed fighting between Huerta’s forces
and opposition leaders, including radical populists Poncho Villa and
Emiliano Zapata and moderate Venustiano Carranza. Huerta fell from power
and Carranza took control of the government in 1914. He was driven from
power by the combined forces of Villa and Zapata in 1915 but later
elected present in the democratic election of 1917. He held the office
of the president until his death in 1920. Following Carranza’s death,
Mexico remained politically unstable until the early 1930s, when Lazaro
Cardenas took power and implemented many of the social reforms that
Carranza had originally suggested when he was in office. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will examine the origins of the Mexican Revolution
and will learn about the political and social objectives of its various
participants. You will also look at how the revolution drastically
altered political culture in Mexico and eventually led to social and
economic reforms that granted more power to the lower and middle
classes. Finally, you will evaluate how the Mexican Revolution inspired
radicals throughout Latin America to challenge conservative political
regimes in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  *

    Before the 1910 Mexican Revolution, a single elite ruling class

    peasants’ plight and stabilize the country, various leaders tried
    different types of agrarian land reform. This text focuses on the
    social changes produced by the agrarian land reform, particularly
    the Cardenista land reform, which redistributed 45,000,000 acres of
    land.
