**Unit 4: Latin America in the Global Economy** <span id="4"></span> 
*From the postcolonial era to the present day, the nations of Latin
America have played a significant role in the global economy. Under
colonial rule, these nations primarily produced agricultural commodities
for export to Europe and served as markets for goods manufactured in
Spain and Portugal. In the postcolonial era, the economic situation
remained similar. Newly independent Latin American nations had few
resources for internal economic development and
industrialization. Instead, they continued to grow and export major
agricultural commodities such as coffee, sugar, and livestock to
Europe. These monoculture export economies placed Latin American nations
at the mercy of the global economy. When commodity prices were high,
growers reaped handsome profits. When commodity prices fell, growers
went out of business or defaulted on loans. European and American
investors provided much of the capital for business development in the
region. Similarly, Europeans and Americans served as technical experts
for development projects such as railroads, factories, and other
high-skill industries. Consequently, outsiders exercised great control
over local and regional markets and transportation systems. The slow
rate of industrialization and outside control of local industries proved
to be a major source of political tension in the region. Populist
political parties agitated against European and American influence in
various Latin American nations. These groups argued that Latin American
nations needed to develop their own internal technical experts through
the creation of institutions of higher education and grow their own
economies through the diversification of agricultural and industrial
production. *  
    
 *In this unit, you will study the ways in which the politics of
economic development shaped the nations of Latin America in the
19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, and you will
examine some of the development projects that took place across the
region. You will also look at export industries such as coffee and sugar
production and see how these global industries shaped working and living
conditions for Latin Americans.  *

     Instructions: Read this brief excerpt from author Pierre Denis’s

    existences. Denis discusses the labor-intensive process of
    harvesting coffee beans and preparing them for export to American or
    European markets. He notes that workers made very little money
    working on fazendas and typically had to raise and sell other crops
    in their spare time in order to make ends meet financially.
